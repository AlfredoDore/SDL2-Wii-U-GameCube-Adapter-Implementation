# SDL2-Wii-U-GameCube-Adapter-Implementation
This project is an SDL2-based implementation for the Nintendo Wii U GameCube Controller Adapter (WUP-028), inspired by the pj64-wiiu-gcn plugin for Project64. It uses libusb to communicate with the adapter and SDL2 for basic event handling, allowing GameCube controller inputs to be read on Windows and Linux.
